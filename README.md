# At the Wall

A scene from Game of Thrones coded in CSS and HTML.
There are no images used whatsoever - only code.

This is the combined work of several frontend developers, including me. 
The purpose was to learn new things and work in a larger team.
As a result we achieved a complex and animations-heavy interactive drawing using SCSS and HTML only.

The team was split into smaller teams (two devs) and each team worked on a part of the drawing.
For example: Jon Snow, The White Walker, the sky, the snowflakes, the wall, the ground and the trees.
I coded the White Walker and supervised the team, provided solutions or hints where needed and when everyone was done I merged their work in a single repository.

The drawing is completely fluid and adjusts itself to any viewport.

This repository contains a PWA version of the drawing, which can be installed on a PWA supported device and/or viewed offline.

## [DEMO](https://codepen.io/scriptex/full/eLWdKN/) and [PWA](https://at-the-wall.now.sh/)

The demo contains a minified version of the HTML and the CSS output.

The PWA can be installed on any device which supports service workers and can be viewed offline.
