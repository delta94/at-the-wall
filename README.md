# At the Wall

A scene from Game of Thrones coded in CSS and HTML.

This is the combined work of several frontend developers, including me. 
The purpose was to learn new things and work in a larger team.
As a result we achieved a complex and animations-heavy interactive drawing using SCSS and HTML only.

**demo will be added soon**

**more details are coming**
